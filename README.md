             Simulation SLAM Using Turtlebot3
             
Robotic Movement is one of the most essential parts while building your robot.
This process consists of four steps: 1-Positioning  2-Sensing 3-Mapping 4-Path
To accomplish the previous steps the robot will do SLAM.
SLAM: Simultaneous localization and mapping.
For the sensing part we will use a Lidar laser scanner. 

But before working on real, we need to build and test our progress.
Simulation is the key.
as a startup, we will use turtlebot3 simulation.
First, download the dependencies packages

Second, download the TurtleBot3 packages

Third, in the simulation sector, install the Gazebo simulation package.

Then, install the TurtleBot3 World

Now Gazebo will open with TurtleBot3 World, but we still cannot see 2-D Gmapping
